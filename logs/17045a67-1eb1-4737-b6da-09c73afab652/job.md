This is a fifth simple test job to continue verifying thepopebot functionality. Please:

1. Create a new file called `test-output-5.md` in the logs directory for this job
2. Write the current date and time to the file
3. Add a message: "Fifth test job executing successfully!"
4. Search for all previous test job outputs and create a summary report
5. Create a JSON file called `test-summary.json` with metadata about all test jobs found
6. Check the current working directory structure and list key files
7. Add performance timing information (how long this job takes to complete)
8. Confirm the job completed successfully by adding a "FIFTH TEST COMPLETE" message at the end

This is the fifth functionality test to verify thepopebot's ability to analyze previous job outputs and maintain performance.
