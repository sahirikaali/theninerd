Create a trip planner agent system with the following components:

1. Create the directory `operating_system/TRIP_PLANNER/` 

2. Create `operating_system/TRIP_PLANNER/TRIP_PLANNER.md` that defines:
   - The bot's role as a trip planning research assistant
   - How to handle country-specific trip planning requests
   - Research areas to cover: weather, current events, safety, attractions, local culture, transportation, accommodation, food, currency, visa requirements
   - Instructions for gathering real-time information
   - Current location context (India)

3. Create `operating_system/TRIP_PLANNER/TRIP_PLANNER_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` that defines:
   - Structured format for trip planning reports
   - Sections for weather forecast, current events impact, safety status, must-visit attractions, cultural insights, practical travel info
   - Professional formatting guidelines
   - Data source citations

4. Create `operating_system/TRIP_PLANNER/TRIP_PLANNER_REPORT.md` as the daily generated report file (initially empty with placeholder content explaining its purpose)

The system should be designed to generate comprehensive, research-backed trip planning reports for any requested country, with special consideration for travelers departing from India.
